README for Nesting NUOPC prototype with multiple nestlings
----------------------------------------------------------

Dependencies:
  - ESMF v7.0.0 beta
  
Build:
  - Set environment variable ESMFMKFILE to point to the esmf.mk of your ESMF
    installation.
  - gmake
  
Execution:
  - Optionally set environment variable ESMF_RUNTIME_COMPLIANCECHECK to ON.
  - mpirun -np X ./mainApp (where X is the total number of PETs)
  
Output:
  - PET*.Log files containing compliance checker output if turned on.
  - The prototype outputs time stepping information to stdout.
  


Code structure:
  - Makefile            - Makefile that is based on the standard esmf.mk 
                          mechanism.
  - advectDiffComp.F90  - Advection-Diffusion model that is recursively nested, 
                          specializing the generic NUOPC_Model.
  - driverComp.F90      - Driver component that sets up nesting, 
                          specializing generic the generic NUOPC_Driver.
  - mainApp.F90         - Main application.
