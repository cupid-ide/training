README for Driver-in-Driver NUOPC prototype of a coupled ATM-OCN through Driver
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dependencies:
  - ESMF v7.0.0 beta
  
Build:
  - Set environment variable ESMFMKFILE to point to the esmf.mk of your ESMF
    installation.
  - gmake
  
Execution:
  - Optionally set environment variable ESMF_RUNTIME_COMPLIANCECHECK to ON.
  - mpirun -np X ./mainApp (where X is the total number of PETs)
  
Output:
  - PET*.Log files containing compliance checker output if turned on.
  - The prototype outputs time stepping information to stdout.
  


Code structure:
  - Makefile              - Makefile that is based on the standard esmf.mk 
                            mechanism.
  - driverChildComp.F90   - Driver child component run from within parent 
                            driver, and looking like an ATM to the outside.
  - atm.F90               - the ATM component driven by driverChildComp.F90
  - driverParentComp.F90  - Driver parent component, driving the driver child
                            component and the OCN model component.
  - ocn.F90               - the OCN component driven by driverParentComp.F90
  - mainApp.F90           - Main application.
