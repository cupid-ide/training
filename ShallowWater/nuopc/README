In this exercise you will create a NUOPC "cap" for a simple
shallow water model using Cupid.  You have already been provided
with several files:

sw_refactor.F90 -- this is a refactored version of the original
	               SW model - it has been changes to a Fortran
	               module instead of a program

sw_driver.F90   -- this is a NUOPC Driver ready to drive a cap
                   called sw_cap
                   
sw_main.F90     -- the Fortran main program

A makefile is also included.  You need to set the environment
variable ESMFMKFILE to point to your ESMF installation's
esmf.mk file.

Your task is to create a NUOPC cap for the SW model in a file
called sw_cap.F90.  It should advertise an export field called 
"height" which should reference the "h" variable in the model.

Challenge:
Add another cap atm.F90 for a ficticious atmosphere model. Have
it advertise an import field "height".  Modify the sw_driver.F90
to drive both sw_cap and atm and use a connector to transfer data
from the SW model to the atmosphere.
